# What is 'fed-ea' project?

It is viewed by its participants as:

* An non-commercial, experimental attempt to enable, improve, expand the "linkedness" of architecture information originally coded and transferred through ArchiMate® standards
* A collection of several open-source specifications and utilities to handle and visualize architecture information
* The "collection" aforementioned can be incorporated into commercial projects based on its license
* The commercial use of the "collection" may require the acquisition or subscription of other commercial licenses (specifically ArchiMate®)
* Every statement along the lines "this project sees/deems/has the position" reflect the non-authoritative opinion of its participants
